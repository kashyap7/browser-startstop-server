Write a script which accepts HTTP calls to Start, stop and cleanup browsers. Each of the operations should be different methods. Proxy setttings should be configurable. It should also take url as optional parameter. It should be done in ruby.

Create a server which would entertain start, stop and cleanup of browsers.
Which browsers?
	- chrome
	- safari
	- firefox
What does cleanup include?
Ideally a cleanup involves clearing the 
	- History
	- Cache
	- Preferences
	- Well the objective is have the start post a cleanup to fetch a freshly installed firefox
Proxy - I have added an endpoint to set/unset the proxy setting instead of clubbing it with the start endpoint

ENDPOINTS

	Launches the 'browser' supplied in the input with the optional 'url', currently only support chrome/firefox/safari
